    "Homes universal is a real estate agency that helps buyers get houses and sellers get the right prices for their houses. As a data scientist I have been tasked with coming up withcoming up with insights that will enable the firm come up with the best prices based on different aspects or characteristics of the houses available and at the same time explain to the buyers the reason for the pricing of certain houses.In order to come up with clear insights that will have impact ,I will apply my analysis based on polynomial regression and Multiple regression modeling.I came up with the following questions to help guide me during my analysis.The aim of this project is to develop a multiple regression model than can predict a house's price"

Houses that are in good condition overally, and have a lot of rooms utimately go for higher prices and the opposite is also true. Houses that have a large sqft_living also go for higher prics as most people tend to appreciate the size and space tht these houses contain."
